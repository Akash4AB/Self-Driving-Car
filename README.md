# Self-Driving-Car
In this project, I've developed a simple simulation of a self-driving car navigating through a track. The car is programmed to make decisions based on its surroundings, using a basic form of computer vision.
Key Features:

Track Visualization: The track layout is visualized using a loaded image onto the Pygame window.
Self-Driving Navigation: The car moves autonomously, changing direction and taking turns as it encounters different scenarios on the track.
Dynamic Perspective: The simulation includes a dynamic perspective camera, which provides the car with a view of its immediate surroundings.
Real-time Decision Making: The car's direction is determined in real-time based on the analysis of pixel data obtained from the camera's perspective.
How It Works:

The car's position and orientation are tracked within the simulation.
Using the Pygame library, I've implemented a loop that continuously updates the car's movement and checks for any obstacles or changes in direction.
Computer vision techniques are applied to analyze the surrounding pixels and make decisions accordingly, mimicking a basic form of self-driving decision-making.
Why It Matters:

This project serves as a simple yet effective demonstration of self-driving car navigation principles.
It showcases the potential of Python and Pygame in creating interactive simulations for educational or entertainment purposes.
Understanding self-driving navigation concepts is crucial in the development of real-world autonomous vehicles, making this project both educational and insightful.
Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different parameters to see how the self-driving car behaves in various scenarios!
